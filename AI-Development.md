# Development Process: Best Practices for Developing AI Systems
###### copyright [S. Volkan Kücükbudak](https://github.com/volkansah)
Developing AI systems requires a careful development process to ensure the systems are safe and reliable. Here are some best practices that should be considered when developing AI systems.

## Use of Tests
Testing is an indispensable part of the development process for AI systems. Through testing, developers can ensure that the system meets the requirements and does not have any serious errors or vulnerabilities.

### The following tests should be carried out when developing AI systems:
- Unit tests: Tests of individual functions and components of the system.
- Integration tests: Tests that ensure the various components of the system can interact with each other.
- Functional tests: Tests that ensure the system meets the specified requirements.
- Performance tests: Tests that ensure the system works efficiently and reliably under various loads.
- Use of Code Reviews: Code reviews are another important part of the development process. Through code reviews, developers can ensure the code is well-structured, easily understandable, and secure. Code reviews should be conducted by at least two people to ensure no serious errors are overlooked.
- Documentation of Security Measures
- Documenting security measures is an important part of the development process for AI systems. Through documentation, developers can ensure that all security aspects of the system have been considered and that the system meets the best available security standards.

### The documentation should include the following information:
- Description of the system and functionalities
- Description of the algorithms and models used
- Description of the data sources and data processing
- Description of the identification and handling of security risks
- Description of emergency plans in case of a security incident
## Conclusion
Adherence to best practices in developing AI systems is crucial to ensuring the system is safe and reliable. Developers should integrate testing, code reviews, and documentation of security measures into the development process to ensure the security and reliability of the system.
