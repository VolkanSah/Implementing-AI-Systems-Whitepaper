# Data protection when using AI technology
###### copyright [S. Volkan Kücükbudak](https://github.com/volkansah)

When developing and deploying AI technology, it is important to keep data privacy in mind. Below are best practices and recommendations you should consider when implementing AI systems.

1. Compliance with data protection regulations: It is of utmost importance that all relevant data protection regulations are adhered to when developing AI systems. This includes compliance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe and corresponding data protection laws in other countries.

2. Avoidance of bias in data: AI systems are based on data that is used to train the algorithms. It is important to ensure that this data does not contain any biases that can lead to discrimination or other unwanted effects. Tools such as data cleaning and data augmentation can be used for this purpose.

3. Ensuring data privacy: The protection of personal data is an important aspect of data privacy. AI systems should be developed and implemented in such a way that they only process personal data when necessary and lawful. It is important to adequately protect the data during processing and storage to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

4. Transparency and education: It is important that users of AI systems are informed about the use of their data. Transparency can be ensured through clear data protection policies and educating users.

5. Review of models: AI models should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they do not have any unintended effects on data privacy. Tools such as model explainability and data lineage can be used for this purpose.

## Conclusion
Data privacy is an important aspect when using AI technology. Compliance with data protection regulations, avoiding bias in data, protecting personal data, transparency and education, as well as reviewing models are essential best practices that should be considered when developing and deploying AI systems.
