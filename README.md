# Secure Implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
###### Whitepaper Copyright bei [S. Volkan Kücükbudak](https://github.com/volkansah)
More and more companies are using AI to improve their applications and services. AI models like ChatGPT from OpenAI are some of the most advanced AI technologies on the market and have the potential to fundamentally change our way of interacting with machines and computers. However, the implementation of AI systems also poses major risks to the security of sensitive data and systems. In this white paper, I provide you with necessary best practices to make your AI integration secure and minimize potential risks. I would like to emphasize that AI is an impressive tool that offers us great potential if used responsibly and securely.

## The reason for this white paper
Every year the same problem: You get harassed by countless, annoying scammers on Youtube, Instagram and Co., who pretend you can earn thousands of euros within a few days. They promise white papers and e-books that supposedly bring security and money. But if you search for these people in the respective search engines, you quickly realize that they are scammers. Even the ZDF allows the broadcast of scam schemes in ZDF Magazin Royal. It's worth a look!

## Caution
Currently, there are many supposed security concepts for companies or free white papers, but often behind the schemes of known scammers is a contract that can cost the next victim thousands of euros. I hope this white paper helps you and encourages many to maintain and care for this Git, so that it can help all those who can't afford their own IT security department.

## Hello Folks
If you find this white paper useful and want to freely share your knowledge, I would be delighted for a discussion and your contributions. I would be happy to maintain this white paper together with you, to give scammers no chance to exploit unknowing companies or people. A detailed explanation of what we are all actually doing on Github and Co., in my opinion, has been missing for a long time. Let's bring a little more justice into the world, because we see that scammers are pouncing on AI technology.

We, who have been gifting our concepts to the free world for years and decades, can only exploit these when we ensure that our accounts have added value for our society. Even if we reveal our tricks and tips, they do not fall into the wrong hands and find their way to you or to others who share their knowledge honestly.

I would be delighted if you support my idea. It really annoys me when I open YouTube and have to let someone who is unknowledgeable explain how my work goes - and that over and over again. No matter which blockers you use, the nonsense is faster!"
