# User Training for Handling AI Systems and the Importance of IT Security
###### copyright [S. Volkan Kücükbudak](https://github.com/volkansah)
When implementing AI systems, it is important that not only the developers, but also the users of the systems are adequately trained. Because if users do not understand the operation and potential of the AI systems or do not know how to handle them safely, security gaps can arise and jeopardize data integrity.

## Here are some best practices for training users to handle AI systems:
- Understandable Documentation: Make sure the AI system's documentation is understandable and accessible to users. Avoid technical terms or details that may be difficult for the average user to understand. Instead, provide clear instructions and examples so that users can successfully use the AI system.
- Training Materials: Create training materials such as training videos, tutorials, or guides to assist users in using AI systems. These materials should cover the system's main features and include step-by-step instructions.
- Regular Training: Regularly train users on AI security issues and how to avoid them. Regular training ensures that users are familiar with the latest security threats and best practices.
- Testing: Ensure that users test the AI system before deploying it in a productive environment. This gives users the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the system and identify potential problems or vulnerabilities.
- Awareness of Data Protection: Train users in handling sensitive data and data protection. Users should be aware of what data the AI system collects and how this data is stored and used.
- IT Security Training: Also train users in IT security to ensure that they are informed about the importance of IT security and best practices such as password security, network security, and antivirus protection.

## Important!
Proper user training can help ensure the security and integrity of AI systems and minimize the risk of security gaps and data protection breaches.
