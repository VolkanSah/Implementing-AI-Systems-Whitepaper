More and more companies are using AI to improve their applications and services. AI models like ChatGPT from OpenAI are some of the most advanced AI technologies on the market and have the potential to fundamentally change our way of interacting with machines and computers. However, the implementation of AI systems also poses major risks to the security of sensitive data and systems. In this white paper, I provide you with necessary best practices to make your AI integration secure and minimize potential risks. I would like to emphasize that AI is an impressive tool that offers us great potential if used responsibly and securely.

## The reason for this white paper
Every year the same problem: You get harassed by countless, annoying scammers on Youtube, Instagram and Co., who pretend you can earn thousands of euros within a few days. They promise white papers and e-books that supposedly bring security and money. But if you search for these people in the respective search engines, you quickly realize that they are scammers. Even the ZDF allows the broadcast of scam schemes in ZDF Magazin Royal. It's worth a look!

## Caution
Currently, there are many supposed security concepts for companies or free white papers, but often behind the schemes of known scammers is a contract that can cost the next victim thousands of euros. I hope this white paper helps you and encourages many to maintain and care for this Git, so that it can help all those who can't afford their own IT security department.
